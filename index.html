        C:\Users\Casters> If you are reading this, it means that i am
        gone from the internet</br>
        It could be a few weeks or a few months</br>
        To make it short I'm tired of not being able to work because of YouTube shorts and Discord</br>
        I want to cut these addictions to be able to focus on school because I'm freewheeling right now</br>
        And if I don't change my rhythm right now my future is going to take a hit</br>
