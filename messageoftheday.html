    <p>Hey folks! Build 4 is here and alot of stuff changed!
    Firstly, this board shows a message of the day, I don't really know if I'll
    change it alot but anyways...The map had a complete rework!
    It's now more ressembling a lab facility than a maze
    AI had a bit of rework so THE NOISE will wander through the lab then you are not near now
    Finally...Something that adds a goal to the game! Guts!
    You gain guts by wandering in the lab, you lose guts if you stay to much as spawn and all of it if you die !
    So know we can say that "the winner" is the one with the most guts!</p>
